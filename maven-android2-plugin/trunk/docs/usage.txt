Android-Maven
----------------

Useful M2 plugin for building Android projects and running tools (such as emulator).
The Eclipse plugin is recommended for day-to-day dev, for now, as it is much more 
productive than running from command line using manual tools or Maven, 
but this can be used for continuous integration builds and the like (and for those that don't use Eclipse). 

1. Gotta have Maven
2. Edit your ~/.m2/settings.xml file so that you have an Android profile (see ../settings.xml for an example).
3. Setup an Android project with typical Maven 2 layout (or edit configuration in pom).
4. Include a pom, see maven-android2-sample for an example (in SVN parallel to the plugin).
5. run "mvn clean package" to generate an R file, setup DEX file, build an APK, and run-install on emulator.
6. Change the execution goals in the pom to adjust what steps run, or do not run, etc.
