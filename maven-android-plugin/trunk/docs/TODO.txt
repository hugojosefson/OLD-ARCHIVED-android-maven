1. Figure out how to define own "packaging"
2. Don't make the "jar", just make the apk (manipulate artifact?)
3. Add windows support
4. Look at multi module/project and res/source List stuff
5. Add mojo tests
6. Update the site style docs
7. Add android.jar to the classpath via the mojo, not as a dep

later: added debugging, more tool options, etc
