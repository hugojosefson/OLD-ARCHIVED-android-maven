Android-Maven
----------------

Useful M2 plugin for building Android projects and running tools.
The Eclipse plugin is recommended for day-to-day dev, as it is much more 
productive than running from command line using manual tools or Maven, 
but this can be used for continuous integration builds and the like (and for those that just don't use Eclipse). 

1. Gotta have Maven 2

2. Edit your ~/.m2/settings.xml file so that you have an Android profile with android.home defined 
(see ../settings.xml for an example).

3. Setup an Android project with typical Maven 2 layout (to use different layout change POM).
See android-maven-sample for an example project and example POM. 

4. Include a POM, see android-maven-sample for an example (in SVN parallel to the plugin), use "apk" packaging .

5. run "mvn clean install" to generate an R file, setup DEX file, build an APK, and run-install on emulator
(will start the emulator for you if not already started, or use existing instance if already running).
Optionally: separately use "mvn generate-sources" to generate R, and "mvn package" to build APK,
or "mvn clean install android:logcat" to launch logcat after installing app in emulator. 

6. Change the execution goals in the pom to adjust what steps run, or do not run, etc.
Goals: validate, genr, apk, emul.
